** Multi temporal image analysis                                  :multitemp:
*** Description
**** Abstract

     This exercise will get you familiar with multi temporal image analysis
     using OTB applications. You will learn some basic Python scripting methods to
     manipulate a set of LandSat-8 images and produce change detection map from
     the image series (read/stack/extract). 

**** Data
  
  We'll use Landsat 8 images. It provides moderate-resolution imagery, from 15
  meters to 100 meters with a revisit time of approx 16 days.

**** Pre-requisites

     - Basic knowledge on *OTB applications*
     - Basic knowledge of Python

**** Achievements

     - Usage of the OTB applications in Python
     - Produce detection map from a image series
*** Steps

**** Concatenate image bands
     - Landsat 8 images are stored in separate directories. Moreover each band
       are inseparate tiff files. Develop a Python script which browse in each
       directory and concatenate image bands in a single vector image. We will
       use those vector images in the following steps of this exercise.
**** LandSat-8 imagery : basic visualization and band combinations
      - Use Monteverdi2 or Ice to visualize Landsat 8 images
**** Radiometric index extraction
**** Change detection using MAD
*** Solutions                                                     :solutions:
**** Concatenate image bands
     #+INCLUDE: "./Scripts/concatenate.py" src python
**** LandSat-8 imagery : basic visualization and band combinations
     - Color Infrared:  5,4,3
     - Natural Color: 4,3,2
     - coastal/aerosol band (band1)
     - cirrus band (band 9) : better detection of cirrus cloud contamination
**** Radiometric index extraction
     #+INCLUDE: "./Scripts/ndvi.py" src python
**** Change detection using MAD

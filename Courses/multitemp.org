** Multi temporal image analysis                                  :multitemp:
*** Description
**** Abstract

     This exercise will get you familiar with multi-temporal image analysis
     using OTB applications. You will learn how to script OTB applications with
     Python to facilitate manipulation of a set of LandSat-8 images and produce
     change detection map from the image series.

**** Data
  
  We'll use Landsat 8 images. It provides moderate-resolution imagery, from 15
  meters to 100 meters with a revisit time of approximately 16 days.
  Images were download on the USGS Earth Explorer website:
  http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/

**** Pre-requisites

     - Basic knowledge on *OTB applications*
     - Basic knowledge of Python

**** Achievements
     - Usage of the OTB applications in Python
     - Produce detection map from a image series

*** Steps

**** Concatenate image bands
     - Landsat 8 images are stored in separate directories. Moreover each band
       are separated in different tif files. Develop a Python script which browse in each
       directory and concatenate image bands in a single vector image. We will
       use those vector images in the following steps of this exercise.
**** LandSat-8 imagery : basic visualization and band combinations
     Use Monteverdi2 or Ice to visualize Landsat 8 images.
     - What is the color composition for "color infrared" visualization?
     - What is the color composition for "Natural color?
     - What is the number of the new coastal/aerosol band in Landsat 8's OLI
       sensor?
     - What is the number of the new cirrus band in Landsat 8's OLI sensor?
**** Radiometric index extraction
     - Develop a Python script which compute NDVI from all Landsat 8 images series.
**** Change detection using MAD
     MAD stands for Multivariate Alteration Detector and is a change detection
analysis technique based on the following : find pairs of linear combination
between bands from image 1 and bands from image 2 that maximize correlation,
each pair being orthogonal with the others.  Subtract each pairs of linear
combination one from each other. This leads to a set of change maps which are
invariant to linear scaling, un-correlated and can be used to perform change
detection with images with different bands and number of bands for instance.

     - What is the OTB applications which allows to perform MAD change detection?
     - What is the command to perform MAD change detection between images from the 2013-07-01 and
       2013-09-19?
     - Which band of the MAD result seems of interest to extract change of fields?
     - Try to perform threshold on this band to extract a detection mask.
     - What is the command top Perform subtraction between NDVI images from the  2013-07-01 and
       2013-09-19?
     - Try also to threshold the result from the previous question.
*** Solutions                                                     :solutions:
**** Concatenate image bands
     #+INCLUDE: "./Scripts/concatenate.py" src python
**** LandSat-8 imagery : basic visualization and band combinations
     - Color Infrared:  5,4,3
     - Natural Color: 4,3,2
     - coastal/aerosol band (band1) (use clamp around min/max with 2% and 8%)
     - cirrus band (band 9) : better detection of cirrus cloud contamination
       (problem with Reunion data)

**** Radiometric index extraction
     #+INCLUDE: "./Scripts/ndvi.py" src python
**** Change detection using MAD
     - *MultivariateAlterationDetector*
     - Here is the command line to produce the MAD change detection on input
       image:

     : $ otbcli_MultivariateAlterationDetector 
     :   -in1 LC81530752013182LGN00_concat.tif 
     :   -in2 LC81530752013262LGN00_concat.tif 
     :   -out ~/temporary/mad_182_262.tif
     
     - It seems that band number 5 allows to discriminate changes on
       agricultural lands. 
     - Threshold using the *BandMath* application. I choose to threshold mad
       values superior to 4.5:
     : $otbcli_BandMath 
     : -il ~/temporary/mad_182_262.tif 
     : -out ~/temporary/mad_182_262_thres.tif uint8
     : -exp "im1b5>=4.5?255:0"

       Still need to filter clouds. MAD filter could take a mask as input in the
       future.

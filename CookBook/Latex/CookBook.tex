\chapter*{Foreword}
\noindent
After almost 5 years of development, the \otb has become a
rich library used in many remote sensing context, from research work
to operational systems. The \app and more recently the
Monteverdi tool has helped to broaden the audience of the library,
giving access to its functionalities to non-developers.

Meanwhile, the \sg has grown to more
than 700 pages of documented code examples, which, combined with the
class documentation with the \dox, allows developer users to find
their way through the \otb so as to write code suiting their
needs.

Yet, the documentation available for non-developers users, using
Monteverdi and \app to perform everyday remote sensing tasks, has been
almost inexistent for all these years, and these users had to learn
the software by themselves or ask for help from more experienced
users. This cookbook aims at fulfilling the need for an appropriate
documentation of the applications built upon the \otb: \mont, and
\app, which are now integrated into the main \otb package and provide
several access mode (command-line, QT interface, QGis plugins, other
languages \ldots).

A general introduction to these tools is first presented, along
with installation instructions. Rather than describing all modules and
applications in an exhaustive way, we then decided to focus on very
common remote sensing tasks, detailing how they can be achieved with
either \mont or an application.

For more information on the \otb, please feel free to visit the \website.

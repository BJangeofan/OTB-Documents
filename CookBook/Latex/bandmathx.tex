\section{BandMathX application (based on muParserX)}\label{sec:bandmathx}
%add intro
This section describes how to use the BandMathX application.



\subsection{Syntax : first elements}\label{ssec:syntax}

The default prefix name for variables related to the ith input is \textit{im(i+1)} 
(note the indexing from 1 to N, for N inputs). The user has the 
possibility to change this default behaviour by setting its own prefix.


In this document, we will keep the default convention. Following list 
summaries the available variables for input \#0 (and so on for every input).

\begin{center} 
\begin{tabular}{||l|l|l||}
\hline
\bf Variables & \bf Description & \bf Type \\
\hline\hline
im1 & a pixel from first input, made of n components/bands (first image is indexed by 1) & Vector \\
im1bj & jth component of a pixel from first input (first band is indexed by 1) & Scalar \\
im1bjNkxp & a neighbourhood ("N") of pixels of the jth component from first input, of size kxp & Matrix \\
im1bjMini & global statistic : minimum of the jth band from first input & Scalar \\
im1bjMaxi & global statistic : maximum of the jth band from first input & Scalar \\
im1bjMean & global statistic : mean of the jth band from first input & Scalar \\
im1bjSum & global statistic : sum of the jth band from first input & Scalar \\
im1bjVar & global statistic : variance of the jth band from first input & Scalar \\
im1PhyX and im1PhyY & spacing of first input in X and Y directions & Scalar \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Variables and their descriptions.}
\label{variables}

Moreover, we also have the generic variables idxX and idxY that represent 
the indices of the current pixel (scalars). 


\begin{center}
\fbox{\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
\begin{center}
Always keep in mind that a pixel of an otb::VectorImage is always represented as a row vector inside the muParserX framework.
\end{center} 
\end{minipage}}
\end{center}

For instance, the following formula (addition of two pixels)
\begin{equation}
  im1+im2
\end{equation}
\label{firstequation}

is correct only if the two first inputs have the same number of bands. 
In addition, the following formula is not consistent even if im1 
represents a pixel of an image made of only one band:

\begin{equation}
  im1+1
\end{equation}

A scalar can't be added to a vector. The right formula is instead 
(one can notice the way that muParserX allows to define vectors on the fly):

\begin{equation}
  im1+\{ 1 \}
\end{equation}

or

\begin{equation}
  im1 + \{1,1,1,...,1\}
\end{equation}

if im1 is made of n components. 

On the other hand, the variable im1b1 for instance is represented as a 
scalar; so we have the following different possibilities:

\begin{center} 
\begin{tabular}{||c|c||}
\hline
\bf Expression & \bf Status \\
\hline\hline
im1b1 + 1 & correct \\
\{im1b1\} + \{1\} & correct \\
im1b1 + \{1\} & incorrect \\
\{im1b1\} + 1 & incorrect \\
im1 + \{im2b1,im2b2\} & correct if im1 represents a pixel of two components (equivalent to  im1 + im2) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Correct / incorrect expressions.}
\label{correctness}


Similar remarks can be made for the multiplication/division; 
for instance, the following formula is incorrect:

\begin{equation}
  \{im2b1,im2b2\} * \{1,2\}
\end{equation}

whereas this one is correct:
\begin{equation}
  \{im2b1,im2b2\} * \{1,2\}'
\end{equation}

or in more simple terms (and only if im2 contains two components): 

\begin{equation}
  im2* \{1,2\}'
\end{equation}

Concerning division, this operation is not originally defined between 
two vectors (see next section "New operators and functions" -\ref{ssec:operators}-).

\begin{center}
\fbox{\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
\begin{center}
Actually, the different remarks above could have been summarized in a very simple manner: muParserX only addresses mathematically well-defined formulas. 
\end{center}
\end{minipage}}
\end{center}

Now, let's go back to the first formula: this one specifies the addition 
of two images band to band. With muParserX lib, we can now define such 
operation with only one formula, instead of many formulas (as many as 
the number of bands). We call this new functionality the \textbf{batch mode}, 
which directly arises from the introduction of vectors within muParserX framework.

Finally, let's say a few words about neighbourhood variables. 
These variables are defined for each particular input, and for each 
particular band. The two last numbers, kxp, indicate the size of the 
neighbourhood. All neighbourhoods are centred: this means that k and p 
can only be odd numbers. Moreover, k represents the dimension in the 
x direction (number of columns), and p the dimension in the y direction 
(number of rows). For instance, im1b3N3x5 represents the following 
neighbourhood: 

\begin{center} 
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
.	& .	& . \\
\hline
.	& .	& . \\
\hline
.	& .	& . \\
\hline
.	& .	& . \\
\hline
.	& .	& . \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Neighborhood of 3x5.}
\label{correctness}

Fundamentally, a neighbourhood is represented as a matrix inside the 
muParserX framework; so the remark about mathematically well-defined 
formulas still stands.

\begin{center}
\fbox{\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
\begin{center}
Another last important remark is the following: the result of the evaluation of a formula can't be a matrix, since it must be mapped to a itk::VariableLengthVector. So the result can only be:
\begin{itemize}
\item an integer, a float, a row vector of dimension 1 (one-band output)
\item a row vector of dimension n (n-bands output)
\end{itemize}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}}
\end{center}


\subsection{New operators and functions}\label{ssec:operators}

New operators and functions have been implemented within 
BandMathX application. These ones can be divided into two categories.

\begin{itemize}
\item adaptation of existing operators/functions, that were not originally defined for vectors and matrices (for instance cos, sin, ...). These new operators/ functions keep the original names to which we add the prefix "v" for vector (vcos, vsin, ...) .
\item truly new operators/functions.
\end{itemize}


Concerning the last category, here is a list of implemented 
operators or functions (they are all implemented in 
otbParserXPlugins.h/.cxx files -OTB/Code/Common-):

\textbf{Operators div and dv} \newline
The first operator allows the definition of an element-wise division of two vectors (and even matrices), provided that they have the same dimensions.
The second one allows the definition of the division of a vector/matrix by a scalar (components are divided by the same unique value). For instance: 

\begin{equation}
	im1 ~ div ~ im2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	im1 ~ dv ~ 2.0
\end{equation}

\textbf{Operators mult and mlt} \newline
These operators are the duals of the previous ones. For instance:

\begin{equation}
	im1 ~  mult ~ im2
\end{equation}
 
\begin{equation}
	im1 ~  mlt ~ 2.0
\end{equation}

Note that the operator '*' could have been used instead of 'pw' one. But 'pw' is a little bit more permisive, and can tolerate one-dimensional vector as right element.

\textbf{Operators pow and pw} \newline
The first operator allows the definition of an element-wise exponentiation of two vectors (and even matrices), provided that they have the same dimensions.
The second one allows the definition of the division of a vector/matrix by a scalar (components are exponentiated by the same unique value). For instance: 

\begin{equation}
	im1 ~ pow ~ im2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	im1 ~ pw ~ 2.0
\end{equation}

\textbf{Function bands} \newline
This function allows to select specific bands from an image, and/or to rearrange them in a new vector; for instance:

\begin{equation}
  bands(im1,\{1,2,1,1\})
\end{equation}

produces a vector of 4 components made of band 1, band 2, band 1 and band 1 values from the first input. Note that curly brackets must be used in order to select the desired band indices.

\textbf{Function dotpr } \newline
This function allows the dot product between two vectors or matrices (actually in our case, a kernel and a neighbourhood of pixels):

\begin{equation}
\sum_{(i,j)} m_1(i,j)*m_2(i,j)
\end{equation}

For instance: 
\begin{equation}
  dotpr(kernel1,im1b1N3x5)
\end{equation}

is correct provided that kernel1 and im1b1N3x5 have the same dimensions. The function can take as many neighbourhoods as needed in inputs.


\begin{center}
\fbox{\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
\begin{center}
Thus, if n neighbourhoods must be processed, the output will consist in a row vector of n values. This behaviour is typical of the functions implemented in the BandMathX application.
\end{center}
\end{minipage}}
\end{center}

\textbf{Function mean} \newline
This function allows to compute the mean value of a given vector or neighborhood (the function can take
as many inputs as needed; one mean value is computed per input). For instance:

\begin{equation}
	mean(im1b1N3x3,im1b2N3x3,im1b3N3x3,im1b4N3x3)
\end{equation}

Note: a limitation coming from muparserX itself makes impossible to pass all those neighborhoods with a unique variable.

\textbf{Function var} \newline
This function allows to compute the variance of a given vector or neighborhood (the function can take
as many inputs as needed; one var value is computed per input). For instance:

\begin{equation}
	var(im1b1N3x3)
\end{equation} 

\textbf{Function median} \newline
This function allows to compute the median value of a given vector or neighborhood (the function can take
as many inputs as needed; one median value is computed per input). For instance:

\begin{equation}
	median(im1b1N3x3)
\end{equation}

\textbf{Function corr} \newline
This function allows to compute the correlation between two vectors or matrices of the same dimensions (the function takes two inputs). For instance:

\begin{equation}
	corr(im1b1N3x3,im1b2N3x3)
\end{equation}

\textbf{Function maj} \newline
This function allows to compute the most represented element within a vector or a matrix (the function can take
as many inputs as needed; one maj element value is computed per input). For instance:

\begin{equation}
	maj(im1b1N3x3,im1b2N3x3)
\end{equation}

\textbf{Function vmin and vmax} \newline
These functions allow to compute the min or max value of a given vector or neighborhood (only one input). For instance:

\begin{equation}
	(vmax(im3b1N3x5)+vmin(im3b1N3x5)) ~ div ~ \{2.0\}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Function cat} \newline
This function allows to concatenate the results of several expressions into a multidimensional vector, whatever their respective dimensions (the function can take
as many inputs as needed). For instance:

\begin{equation}
	cat(im3b1,vmin(im3b1N3x5),median(im3b1N3x5),vmax(im3b1N3x5))
\end{equation}

Note: the user should prefer the use of semi-colons (;) when setting expressions, instead of directly use this function.
The application will call the function 'cat' automatically.  


\textbf{Function ndvi} \newline
This function implements the classical normalized difference vegetation index; it tkaes two inputs. For instance:

\begin{equation}
	ndvi(im1b1,im1b4)
\end{equation}

First argument is related to the visible red band, and the second one to the near-infrareds band.

The table below summarises the different functions and operators.

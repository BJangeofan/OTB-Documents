As we have seen in the previous chapter, OTB has a great capability to
read and process images. However, images are not the only type of data
we will need to manipulate. Images are characterizes by a regular sampling
grid. For some data, such as DEM, Lidar, this is too restrictive and we need
other representations.

Finally, vector data are also used to represent cartographic objects,
segmentation results, etc: basically, everything which can be seen as point,
line or polygons. OTB provides functionnalities for accessing this kind of data.

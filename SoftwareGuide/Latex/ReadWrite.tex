\chapter{Reading and Writing Images}
\label{sec:IO}

This chapter describes the toolkit architecture supporting reading and
writing of images to files. OTB does not enforce any particular file
format, instead, it provides a structure inherited from ITK,
supporting a variety of formats that can be easily extended by the
user as new formats become available.

We begin the chapter with some simple examples of file I/O.

The following section describes the internals of the IO architecture provided
in the toolbox.

\section{Pluggable Factories}
\label{sec:ImageIOPluggableFactories}

The principle behind the input/output mechanism used in ITK and
therefore OTB is known as
\emph{pluggable-factories} \cite{Gamma1995}. This concept is illustrated in
the UML diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:ImageIOCollaborationDiagram}. From the
user's point of view the objects responsible for reading and writing files
are the \doxygen{otb}{ImageFileReader} and \doxygen{otb}{ImageFileWriter}
classes. These two classes, however, are not aware of the details involved in
reading or writing particular file formats like PNG or GeoTIFF.  What they do
is to dispatch the user's requests to a set of specific classes that are
aware of the details of image file formats. These classes are the
\doxygen{itk}{ImageIO} classes. The ITK delegation mechanism enables users to
extend the number of supported file formats by just adding new classes to the
ImageIO hierarchy.

Each instance of ImageFileReader and ImageFileWriter has
a pointer to an ImageIO object. If this pointer is empty, it will
be impossible to read or write an image and the image file reader/writer must
determine which ImageIO class to use to perform IO operations.
This is done basically by passing the filename to a centralized class, the
\doxygen{itk}{ImageIOFactory} and asking it to identify any subclass of
ImageIO capable of reading or writing the user-specified file. This
is illustrated by the use cases on the right side of
Figure~\ref{fig:ImageIOFactoriesUseCases}. The ImageIOFactory acts here as a
dispatcher that help to locate the actual IO factory classes corresponding to
each file format.

Each class derived from ImageIO must provide an associated factory
class capable of producing an instance of the ImageIO class. For
example, for PNG files, there is a \doxygen{itk}{PNGImageIO} object that knows how
to read this image files and there is a \doxygen{itk}{PNGImageIOFactory} class
capable of constructing a PNGImageIO object and returning a pointer
to it.  Each time a new file format is added (i.e., a new ImageIO
subclass is created), a factory must be implemented as a derived class of the
ObjectFactoryBase class as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:ImageIOFactoriesClassDiagram}.

For example, in order to read PNG files, a PNGImageIOFactory is
created and registered with the central ImageIOFactory
singleton\footnote{\emph{Singleton} means that there is only one instance of
this class in a particular application} class as illustrated in the left side
of Figure~\ref{fig:ImageIOFactoriesUseCases}. When the ImageFileReader asks
the ImageIOFactory for an ImageIO capable of reading the
file identified with \emph{filename} the ImageIOFactory will iterate over the
list of registered factories and will ask each one of them is they know how
to read the file. The factory that responds affirmatively will be used to
create the specific ImageIO instance that will be returned to the
ImageFileReader and used to perform the read operations.

With respect to the ITK formats, OTB adds most of the remote sensing
image formats. In order to do so, the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library, GDAL
      \url{http://www.gdal.org/}, is encapsultated in a ImageIO
      factory. GDAL is a translator library for raster
      geospatial data formats that is released under an X/MIT style
      Open Source license. As a library, it presents a single abstract
      data model to the calling application for all supported formats,
      which include CEOS, GeoTIFF, ENVI, and much more. See
      \url{http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html} for
      the full format list.

      Since GDAL is itself a multi-format library, the GDAL IO
factory is able to choose the appropriate ressource for reading and
writing images. 

In most cases the mechanism is transparent to the user who only interacts
with the ImageFileReader and ImageFileWriter. It is
possible, however, to explicitly select the type of ImageIO object
to use.  Please see the ITK Software for more details about this.

Images whose pixel type is a Vector, a CovariantVector, an Array, or a Complex
are quite common in image processing. One of the uses of these tye of
images is the processing of SLC SAR images, which are complex.

%% \section{Reading and Writing Image Series}

%% It is still quite common to store 3D medical images in sets of files each one
%% containing a single slice of a volume dataset. Those 2D files can be read as
%% individual 2D images, or can be grouped together in order to reconstruct a 3D
%% dataset. The same practice can be extended to higher dimensions, for example,
%% for managing 4D datasets by using sets of files each one containing a 3D image.
%% This practice is common in the domain of cardiac imaging, perfusion, functional
%% MRI and PET. This section illustrates the functionalities available in ITK for
%% dealing with reading and writing series of images.

\section{Reading and Writing Vector Data}
\index{vector data}
\label{sec:ReadingVectorData}
In Remote Sensing the use of vector data is common. Vector data is
used to represent cartographic objects, segmentation results, etc:  
basically, everything which can be seen as point, line or polygons. OTB
provides functionnalities for accessing this kind of data.

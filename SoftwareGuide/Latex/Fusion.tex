\section{Introduction}

Satellite sensors present an important diversity in terms of characteristics.
Some provide a high spatial resolution while other focus on providing several
spectral bands. The fusion process brings the information from different
sensors with different characteristics together to get the best of both
world.

The most studies case of the data fusion is the PAN+XS. This fusion combines
the image from the PAN sensor of one satellite (high spatial resolution data)
with the XS data (lower resolution in 4 spectral bands) to generate images with
a high resolution and 4 spectral bands. Several advantages make this situation
easier:

\begin{itemize}
\item PAN and XS images are taken simultaneously from the same satellite (or
with a very short delay)
\item area is common to both scenes
\item many satellites provide these data (SPOT 1-5, Quickbird, Pleiades)
\end{itemize}

This case is well-studied in the litterature and many methods exists. Only very
few are available in OTB now but this should evolve soon.

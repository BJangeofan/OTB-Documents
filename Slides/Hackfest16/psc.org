   3. Developments
   4. Requests for changes
   5. Review
   6. PSC Vote
   7. Request for Merge
   8. Approval by Release Manager
   9. Merge

** Facts and figures
*** Request for changes
    http://wiki.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php/Requests_for_Changes
    - OTB 5.2: 19 Requests for Changes
    - OTB 5.4: 14 Requests for Changes
    - Pending: 7 Requests for Changes
*** Requests for comments
    http://wiki.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php/Requests_for_Comments

* What has changed
** ... for users
- Every significant ongoing or passed change is now public and visible
- Users have the opportunity to comment on pending Request for Changes during review
- There are more details available on why and how things were done (and discussions)
- Users can file new Request for Comments to request new features

** ... for contributors

- There is a clear and detailed process on how to get your code in OTB
- Contributors are guaranteed to be treated with equity

** ... for developers

- No more silent merging of your 100+ commits branch
- $\Rigtharrow$ Some adjustments needed:
  - Accept comments from review
  - Getting the code merged takes more time
- On the bright side, less surprises on the /develop/ branch

* Thoughts

** Are we making a better OTB? Pros.
On the overall, I think that we do.
- we have more code reviews, from external reviewer (Luc, are you there?)
- Changes are more consistent because they belong to the same RFC
- Everyone gets to give his opinion
- New feature are more visible

** Are we making a better OTB? Cons.

- PSC is still small and has a lot of CNES in it
- Appart from CNES/CS funded by CNES/CS, we have very few requests for changes
- We do Gerrit. By Hand. 
- We still have broken dashboards, packages, and third party issues

** Is voting really required?

** Do comments become changes (and vice versa) ?

** PSC, git workflow, release process: high coupling

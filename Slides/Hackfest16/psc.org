* Introduction
** Happy birthday PSC!
- One year ago, CNES decided to set-up an open-governance for OTB
- We now have a working PSC, with:
  - Members
  - Rules
  - Decisions

** PSC, git workflow, release process: high coupling 
   
   PSC established (or endorsed) a set of highly coupled process:
     - RFC process
     - The git workflow
     - The testing/dashboard strategy
     - The release process
     - The packaging strategy


** A short reminder of RFC process
   1. *Request for Comments*
   2. Comments and discussions
   3. Developments
   4. *Requests for changes*
   5. Review
   6. PSC Vote
   7. *Request for Merge*
   8. Approval by Release Manager
   9. Merge

** A short reminder of Git Workflow

** A short reminder of release process

   1. Release manager accepts Requests for Merge corresponding to PSC approved Request for Changes
   2. Every 3 months, at a planned date, Release Manager branches develop which becomes the Release Candidate
   3. After one or two weeks of testing and fixing, release is announced

** Facts and figures
*** Request for changes
    http://wiki.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php/Requests_for_Changes
    - OTB 5.2: 19 Requests for Changes
    - OTB 5.4: 14 Requests for Changes
    - Pending: 7 Requests for Changes
*** Requests for comments
    http://wiki.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php/Requests_for_Comments
    - 31 Requests for Comments 

* What has changed
** ... for users
- Every significant ongoing or passed change is now public and visible
- Users have the opportunity to comment on pending Request for Changes during review
- There are more details available on why and how things were done (and discussions)
- Users can file new Request for Comments to request new features
- Releases are more frequent

** ... for contributors

- There is a clear and detailed process on how to get your code in OTB
- Contributors are guaranteed to be treated with equity
- They know the deadline to get their feature into next release

** ... for developers

- No more silent merging of your 100+ commits branch
- $\Rigtharrow$ Some adjustments needed:
  - Accept comments from review
  - Getting the code merged takes more time
- On the bright side, less surprises on the /develop/ branch
- They know the deadline to get their feature into next release

* Thoughts

** Are we making a better OTB? Pros.
On the overall, I think that we do.
- we have more code reviews, from external reviewer (Luc, are you there?)
- Changes are more consistent because they belong to the same RFC
- Everyone gets to give his opinion
- New features are more visible

** Are we making a better OTB? Cons.

- PSC is still small and has a lot of CNES in it
- Appart from CNES/CS funded by CNES/CS, we have very few requests for changes
- We do Gerrit. By Hand. 
- We still have broken dashboards, packages, and third party issues

** Is voting really required?
   
   - PSC never voted -1 (or even +0)
   - Upon RFC, what really happens:
     - PSC members (and others) make comments
     - No vote is casted until those comments are adressed
   - Indeed no RFC has been rejected
   - But some are still waiting for enough +1
   - Shall we replace vote by a simpler approval system?
   

** Do comments become changes ?

*** Request for comments
- We have a lot of Request for Comments
- They describe some new idea, like a whitepaper
- Once the idea is submitted, they do not remain active very long

*** Request for changes
- We have a lot of request for changes that do not come from request
  for comments
- It means that work is already done and we can only discuss the details
- Sometime review shows that the feature was in fact unclear
- Make it mandatory?

** PSC meetings
    
   - There has been 3 IRC meeting in between 2015 and 2016 user days
   - Logs and minutes are available on the wiki
   - A face to face meeting is planned during 3rd day (Hackfest)
   - Meetings are too long $\Rigtharrow$ should we do them more often?
   - Only place where important matters (other than RFC) are discussed

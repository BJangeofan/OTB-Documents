* Introduction
** Legal presentation
   - I'm going to start a presentation on legal issues -> Please don't leave now
   - IANAL ("I am not a lawyer")
   - Legal questions does actually matter (packaging, contributions, governance...)
   - State of OSGeo incubation process for OTB
   - Code provenance review
   - Moving OTB license from CeCILL (GPL) to Apache v2
** Why legal issues matter?
    - Why does it take so long to have OTB package in Debian?
    - What is the difference between Apache and GNU GPL license?
    - What is the difference between GNU GPL and CeCILL?
    - Why not changing OTB license to the WTFPL license (Do What the /f-word/
      You Want to Public License) ?
    - Is it difficult to re-license a software ? /most of the time, yes/ [fn:1]
* OSGeo incubation
** OSGeo incubation
*** OSGeo
    - The Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)
      - Not-for-profit organization
      - Software foundation
      - Mission is to foster global adoption of open geospatial tech
*** OSGeo incubation 
    - Incubation committee: responsible for overseeing the incubation process for new projects
    - OTB apply in 2011 -> mentor : Landon Blake
    - Everyone is benevolent
    - Checklist to complete the incubation 
    - Long process, lead to sometimes long discussions...
    - IMHO very valuable for OTB to improve and structure the project 
** OTB incubation checklist
   - OSGeo wiki: https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OTB_Project_Incubation_Status
*** Status report
     - Infrastructure Transition (website, source access...) -> *OK*
     - Community Functioning -> Set up OTB PSC and  project procedures -> *OK* 
     - Foundation Membership -> brand OTB site with OSGeo foundation -> *OK* 
     - Code Copyright Review and Committer Responsibilities Guidelines -> In progress
** Code provenance review
*** Contributions since 2006
    - All OTB dependencies are license in Apache/MIT
    - All contributions licensed in  CeCILL
    - No contributor agreement for committers (no CLA, CCLA)
    - Discussion (initiate by CNES) to move OTB license from CeCILL to Apache
*** Strategy
   - Check (again) the compatibility of third part libraries with OTB
     - Most
     - 6S (Radiative transfer) : provide with no license -> working on it
   - Code provenance review:
     - List all files and identify contributors
     - *Completed*
     - Contributors have been contacted to sign a CLA (adapted from Apache CLA)
* Moving from GPL to Apache
** Moving from GPL to Apache
*** How does Apache 2.0 license differ from GPL?
    - Permissive
    - Apache: you're not required to distribute the source code of a covered work

*** Re-licensing
    - Code provenance review and contributor agreements is necessary condition
    - But not sufficient! Also need to be discuss thorough an RFComments and a RFC
    - Would not change much things for most users and contributors
    - CNES committed to continue to contribute to the library

* Conclusion

** Conclusion
   - OSGeo incubation starts in 2011 (first application)
   - Not far for OTB to be a member
   - Being an official OSGeo soft will not change lots of thing
   - But I think that the incubation helps OTB to have a more open
   - Code provenance review completed
   - Moving to GPL to Apache was already discuss on OTB blog but it should lead
     to an RFC and discussion (their is already a RFComments)

** Questions ?

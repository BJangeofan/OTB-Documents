* The plan
 - OTB Users want to use OTB applications through commandline, application launcher, monteverdi.
 - OTB developers add new odules, applications into OTB for users.  Sometimes (ahemm..) they find small bugs and report  or fix them ASAP
 - Both of them don't want to spend a half a day on setting up OTB
 - "The Plan" is to let have OTB as the easiest way possible.!

* Old Packaging strategy
- Starts right after source archvies are published.
- Check if any of our dependencies are messed up in official repository. (OSGeo4W, ubunutgis, Fedora, EPEL, MacPorts, Homebrew)
- 90% of time they do mess up with anything or everything.
- We disable some modules and or application due to respective packaging policy
- We copy-paste/fork existing packaging specs in OTB-DevUtils and keep adding stuff to make it work with OTB X.Y
- We start building OTB and push new packages (OSGeo4W, ubunutugis (LTS + two versions), Fedora (last three versions)

\framebreak

* Packages are ready!
- Our users and developers help us find a crash, an otb application, dll or a symbol not found.. so on and so forth.  
- Now OTB team keep swirling through the last two weeks work to find what did we miss and fix them.
- This has become a sad but important excersise taking out 2-3 week developer time!
- Also by the time we fix and upload newer package, user had already passed on building OTB from source!

Why couldn't we fix this once and for all?

\framebreak

* So we need a package that...
  - .. works on Linux (all distribution), Windows, Mac OSX.
  - .. works flawlessly for next 10 years!
  - .. can be installed without installing anything on your OS.
  - .. does not require a sys admin for installation.
  - .. does not make any new “entries” in bug tracker.
  - .. does not distract developer crowd from fixing cirtical bugs to adding cool features and documentation!
  - To sum up, an awesome package!

\framebreak

* Solution
  We did solve this problem with our current packaging strategy!
** OTB Package
 - OTB make binary packages from and with superbuild.
 - This make sure it is tested daily and dependencies are A-okay!
 - We bake them on a daily basis from develop branch.
 - We keep them release ready for any day!
 - Target platforms covered are Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOSX 10.9+

\framebreak

** XDK
- What is XDK ?
- XDK stands for external dependencies kit.  
- You have probably heard about SDK, the Software development Kit.
- It is technically same. we call it differently.

\framebreak

** What it can offer to developers
 - XDK provides a setup that can be used to build OTB from source without having any other dependencies.
 - You can think of it as a binary version of all packages in SuperBuild except OTB!
 - XDK support a list fixed of c++ compilers and their versions. 

** What are it requirements ? 
 The requirements of OTB XDK are minimal depending on your platform of choice.
 - Linux: Unix shell (prefreably bash),  GCC 4.x
 - Mac OSX : Xcode, Apple Clang
 - Windows :  7zip, MinGW64 toolchain (32bit or 64bit)
 - All cases: CMake

\framebreak

* Advantages

** Where do I start...

- Package is a self-extracting archive with a .run extension.
- You only need a working unix shell to install OTB!
- You only need GLIBC to use OTB!
- You only need X11 libs to use monteverdi!
- RPATH mechanism is employed during installation.
- Can co-exist multiple installation of OTB with zero issues!
- Each packages links with their own copy of GDAL, ITK ..
- OTB executables (monteverdi, ApplicationLauncher) are portable!
- You can even build your own custom binary package using OTB-Superbuild to use in your enterpise or university!

\framebreak

* Issues
** Known issues
- Monteverdi has a look and feel problem. 
- Cannot work if GLIBC is older than 2.2.5
- Only 64bit packages are available for GNU/Linux and OSX
- XDK does not support all tribes of compilers.(GCC 6, IntelCC, borland, msvc)

\framebreak

* Conclusion

** Did we reached our goal?
- Yes. Indeed!
 - I worked on this task. So I am biased...But you can test it yourself!
- With 5.4.0, we have zero bug reported on packaging side.
- I know this can be Schrödinger's cat problem. 
- Someone has to open up a mantis bug report (the box) to say cat it is dead.
- But I say cat is alive and happy now!.
